This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
getwd()
# could check for a directory called data with
# if(!dir.exists("data")){dir.create("data")}
# if we want the read file to be in a data directory
fileURL <- "https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/dz54-2aru/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
download.file(fileURL, destfile="./camera.csv")
# download.file(fileURL, destfile="./data/camera.csv")

# note if it is an excel file instead of a csv then do
# library(xslx)
# cameras <- read.xlsx("filename.xlsx", sheetIndex=1, header=TRUE)

list.files()
dateDownloaded <- date()
dateDownloaded
cameras <- read.csv("./camera.csv")
# OR can do: read.table("./camera.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE, quote="", na.strings="NA")
summary(cameras)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
