Notes about Data Tables

```{r}
library(data.table)

#compare DF and data table
DF <- data.frame(x=rnorm(9), y=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=3),z=rnorm(9))
head(DF,3)

DT = data.table(x=rnorm(9), y=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=3),z=rnorm(9))
head(DT,3))

# view all tables in memory
tables()

# subsetting is very similar
DT[2,]

DT[DT$y=="a",]

# subsetting rows a bit different
# get 2nd and 3rd rows
DT[,c(2,3)]

# subsetting columns is quite different
# this doesn't work like a DF
# try to get 2nd and 3rd column
DT[,c(2,3)]

# it turns out that any argument you pass after a comma in an expression
# that you want to apply to the DT
# for example this will spit out the mean of the x values and the sum of the # z values
# we passed in a list of the functions we want to apply
DT[,list(mean(x),sum(z))]

# add a new column w that has the z^2 values in it
DT[,w:=z^2]

#table of the y values
DT[,table(y)]

# note that DT2 <- DT doesn't make a copy so operations on DT will affect DT2

#multiple operations
DT[,m:= {tmp <- (x+z); log2(tmp+5)}]

# plyr like
DT[,a:=x>0]
DT[,b:=mean(x+w),by=a]

# special variables
set.seed(123)
DT <- data.table(x=sample(letters[1:3],1E5,TRUE))

# .N does a count, in this case, grouped by the letters in x
DT[, .N, by=x]

# keys can speed things up
DT <- data.table(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=100, y=rnorm(100)))
setkey(DT, x)
DT['a']

# can use keys for joins
DT1 <- data.table(x=c('a','a','b','dt1'),y=1:4)
DT2 <- data.table(x=c('a','b','dt2'),z=5:7)
setkey(DT1,x); setkey(DT2,x)
merge(DT1,DT2)


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
